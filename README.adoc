== Introduction

This github project contains a port of the examples from the excellent
book http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028970.do[*Feeback Control for computer Systems*] from Philipp K. Janert
to the Java language. In the book the examples are in https://www.python.org[Python], here they are in Java 8.

You will not find much explanation here about the examples, I assume you read the book yourself and
wan't to try the examples yourself on the JVM. The book is written very well and compact,
so the time for reading it is spent well.

Personally, I think the topic *feedback control* is very promising for a lot of problems
in computer systems and I assume, most of the software engineers don't know about it,
although they use *feedback control* everyday without even noticing it
(toilet flush? car cruise control? room temperature control? ...). At least for me this was true since 2015.

== How to run the examples

=== Via gradle (wrapper)

Clone the git repo to your local machine, 'cd' to the created dir and call

----
> ./gradlew run
----

This will build the project, download all dependencies and startup the slightly modified http://www.groovy-lang.org/groovyconsole.html[groovy console].
Run the code with the "Execute Groovy Script" Button in the toolbar. Open the examples via the "Open Groovy Script" Button in the toolbar (and yes, select a java-File).

=== Via IDE

Clone the repo directly and import it into your favourite IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, ...).

Afterwards you can run the examples directly from the IDE (start e.g. with `Ch13_cache_closedloop_jumps.java`).

== Requirements

Java 8

== Support

Please use GitHub issues and pull requests for support.

== Motivation

Since I wasn't familiar with python and I usually work on the JVM
with Java 7/8 and http://www.groovy-lang.org/index.html[Groovy],
I thought it would be nice to have the code in a for me more familiar language.
Also by porting it (and sometimes writing unit-tests for it), I became more familiar with the examples and to a deeper understanding of the topic.

I also thought it would be nice to be able to change the code
and see the resulting chart in the same "environment" with one tool.
Therefor the groovy console with the http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart[JFreeChart] integration.

And last but not least, I think I'll do some more work in this field, thinking of experimenting instead of "just" simulating
with e.g. a dynamic sized thread-pool which adjusts itself to a given CPU load factor. For this, a lot of this
code here comes handy then.
